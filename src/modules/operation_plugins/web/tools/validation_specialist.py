<mandate>
Prevent false positives via 7-gate validation checklist. Each gate must PASS for verified status.
</mandate>

<seven_gates>
<gate id="1" name="Baseline Artifact">
  - Requirement: Pre-exploit state captured in artifact
  - Test: Artifact file exists and readable
  - Failure: No baseline comparison possible
</gate>

<gate id="2" name="Exploit Artifact">
  - Requirement: Post-exploit state captured in artifact
  - Test: Artifact file exists and readable
  - Failure: No exploit evidence
</gate>

<gate id="3" name="Content Differential">
  - Requirement: Semantic content change (not just metadata)
  - Test: diff baseline vs exploit shows meaningful change
  - Failure: Status/size change only = Same layer, different variation
</gate>

<gate id="4" name="Causality">
  - Requirement: YOUR change caused THEIR response change
  - Test: Repeat exploit→same outcome | Omit exploit→different outcome
  - Failure: Non-reproducible or correlation without causation
</gate>

<gate id="5" name="Data Extraction">
  - Requirement: If claiming "extracted X", X must be IN response
  - Test: grep exploit_artifact for claimed data (e.g. session_token, admin hash)
  - Failure: Claimed data NOT in response (was in payload sent, not received)
</gate>

<gate id="6" name="Layer Discrimination">
  - Requirement: Backend reached, not just different defensive layer
  - Test: Response contains application content (not WAF/CDN/challenge page)
  - Failure: Same error type (both Cloudflare, both WAF) = Same layer
</gate>

<gate id="7" name="Authorization">
  - Requirement: Bypass claims need 2xx + protected data
  - Test: 40x = Authorization blocking (NOT bypassed) | 2xx + data = Bypass
  - Failure: "Got 403" ≠ "Bypassed auth" (403 = blocked)
</gate>
</seven_gates>

<decision_logic>
ALL gates PASS:
  - validation_status: "verified"
  - confidence: No penalty
  - severity_max: As claimed (CRITICAL/HIGH)

ANY gate FAILS:
  - validation_status: "hypothesis"
  - confidence: Deduct 15% per failed gate
  - severity_max: Cap at MEDIUM (too weak for HIGH/CRITICAL)

Layer confusion (defensive layer mistaken for backend):
  - severity_max: Cap at INFO
</decision_logic>

  "recommendation": "Specific next action"
}
</output_format>

<execution_protocol>
1. Use editor to read each artifact in artifact_paths
2. Apply gates systematically (don't skip any)
3. For extraction claims: grep artifact for specific data
4. For bypass claims: diff artifacts for semantic content change
5. Document which gates passed/failed with evidence
6. Return JSON result only
